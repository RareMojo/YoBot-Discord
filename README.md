## Features
### Accessibility
YoBot is meant to be deployed without any knowledge of Python or Discord.py, or programming.

The base bot has some basic functionality and can be used as is.

You can download pre-made extensions to add more features to your bot without any programming knowledge.

You can even try to create your own extensions without touching <i>ANY</i> of the source code.

Creating a Cog extension is a great way to learn Python and Discord.py without having to worry about the rest of the bot.

<br>

### OS Compatibility
YoBot is designed to function on both Windows and Linux out of the box.

There are no plans to make support for any other platforms at this time.

<br>

### Logging & Terminal Commands
YoBot uses a custom logging module to handle the terminal log, log files, and terminal commands.

These commands allow for great customizability and control without digging through a bunch of files and code.

You can easily create new commands for the terminal and it is another great way to learn Python without having to worry about the rest of the bot.

Start creating them in `terminalcommands.py` within class `YobotTerminalCommands()`.

<br>

### Extensions
Extensions are intended for additional modular features to extend the functionality of YoBot.

These are usally called Cogs and can be a number of things. Learn more about Cogs [here.](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/cogs.html)

Each [Cog](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/cogs.html) is expected to be a separate Python script implementing a particular feature or set of features.

<br>
    
## Usage
For complete usage please see the [YobotWiki](https://github.com/RareMojo/YoBot-Discord/wiki).

<br>

### Installation
The only prerequisites are a Discord App, Python, Git, and requirements.txt.

See the install guide [here](https://github.com/RareMojo/YoBot-Discord/wiki/Installation)

---

### Configuration
This is done automatically at launch and requires user input for a few details.

You can also edit the config file directly or using various terminal commands.

See more information [here](https://github.com/RareMojo/YoBot-Discord/wiki/Configuration)

---

### Getting Cogs
To install pre-made Cogs, you can use the terminal command `getcog`.

You can also review Cogs or manually install them from [here](https://github.com/RareMojo/YoBot-Discord-Cogs).

As always, you can try to make your own Cogs without touching any of the source code.
